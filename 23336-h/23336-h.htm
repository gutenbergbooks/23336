<p>I have been to see my little

three years old, and I love her
dearly. She has many things
to play with. She has a ball,
a rattle, and a horse; and she
had a nice wax doll given her
last Christmas, but as she got
the paint off its face by kissing,
it is laid by till she is bigger.
We played she was my baby,
and I dressed her up and took
her to walk; after that we played
have tea, and then I rocked her
to sleep, and she looked so nice
I could not help kissing her. She
is coming to see me next week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

the water! He says, when he
comes home he will bring

some fine playthings. I hope

<p>This little girl is having a
ride. She has a nice carriage,
and a pretty goat for a
horse. I think her brother must
be very kind to her. I had a
ride in a goat carriage once; it
was on Boston Common; father
put little Arthur and me into
the carriage, and we rode along,
holding the reins, as happy as
could be. After the ride was
over, we went to the Public
Garden and fed the ducks and
fishes, and then we had a sail
in the boat. I hope we shall
go again next summer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_LION" id="THE_LION"></a>THE LION.</h2>


<p>Let me tell you a short story
about a Lion. Once a poor
Negro found that a Lion was
following him, as he was walking
along through the woods.
The Lion was watching for a
chance to spring upon him. The
man was very much frightened,
but walked swiftly along till he
came to a very steep bank; here
he quickly placed his hat and
cloak on a bush, to make it look
like a man, and then he crept
away. The Lion, thinking it
was the man, was silly enough
to spring upon the cloak, and
tumbled on the rocks below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry had seen a squirrel
in a cage; he had watched
him whirling about and cracking
his nuts, and he longed to
have one of his own; so he
built a trap-cage, and set it near
the great nut tree. He set it
in the morning, and then went
to school, but he could not study
much for thinking of the trap.
After school it did not take him
long to visit the old nut tree,
and lo! there was a little squirrel
in his trap; but little squirry
soon got away, as you see, and
ran off to the woods, happy
enough to get his liberty again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
